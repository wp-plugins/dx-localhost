Display a yellow notice box when you're working on localhost

== Description ==

Display a notice when working on a localhost site clone.

Activate the plugin and see a yellow notice bar indicating that you're working on localhost.

Super helpful whenever you're cloning a production website with virtual hosts using the same domain name, and are not sure which site are you editing. Visible both in the admin area, and the frontend to all site visitors.
